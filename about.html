          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            We are a federation of parties across Government, the private sector and academia.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            We have a shared vision of developing a repeatable toolkit to build configurable, scalable, privacy enabled ecosystems for participants who share common domains of interest and are motivated to share insight/signals about those domains, but who want neither to share a common information infrastructure nor to rely on fragile point-to-point messaging structures.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The toolkit comprises two parts: a technical specification based on open standards and a default governance framework that addresses rules of engagement, legislation and ethics.

          <h2 class="drac-heading drac-heading-lg drac-text-purple-cyan">Background</h2>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            During the summer of 2019, the Open Identity Exchange (OIX) facilitated a Discovery Project involving HMRC, DWP, GDS, banks, other commercial entities and representatives from academia that sought to explore event-based data assurance.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The underlying premise was that during the course of day-to-day business, entities interact with other entities (such as their customers, staff, suppliers, etc.) in ways that can be used to assure the quality of the data associated with the latter.  The Discovery Project’s incoming hypothesis was that managed access to a digital record of such interactions would constitute a valuable service to others - that the borrowing of due diligence would open up new possibilities.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The findings, conclusions and recommendations from the Discovery Project were published as an OIX Whitepaper “Building a Trusted Environment: Event-based Attribute Assurance” which can be found on the OIX website.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The Whitepaper recommended the establishment of an OIX Alpha Project with the objective of agreeing a set of common requirements to support the provision, exchange and consumption of Events. The common requirements would be adopted by collaborating entities willing to share the value of the processes, activities and claims that the Events represent, using them to meet their own – potentially different – data assurance needs.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Following the completion of the Discovery Project, several organisations (HMRC, Future Borders, Food Standards Agency (FSA), GDS, Idemia and other commercial and academic entities) put forward resources to deliver an OIX facilitated Alpha Project to meet this brief, with the intention of taking the work forward into a subsequent Beta Project, where the generalised standards and rules of engagement developed in the Alpha could be deployed in the context of a specific use case that would be of value to those organisations, to act as a reference ecosystem deployment.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Two of these organisations, Future Borders (Cabinet Office) and HMRC created the Open Ecosystem Federation in late January 2020 as a new initiative under the stewardship of the Distributed Systems Group (a large set of collaborating entities comprising government, industry and academia). FSA joined the OEF right after this in February taking the core members to three.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The OEF maintains an association with OIX in order to protect the co-design and evolution of the open standards and artefacts which are created through the various phases of the project.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The Alpha Project was launched towards the end of January 2020 and ran until the end of March. The target content was discussed over the course of nine workshops, the last of which took place on 25th March.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Over the course of the summer, a smaller group of project participants then set out to detail the “Ecosystem Toolkit”, which comprises both a Technical Specification and – importantly – Rules of Engagement to provide a configurable framework for collaboration.
