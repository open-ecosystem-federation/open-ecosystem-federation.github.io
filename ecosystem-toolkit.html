          <h2 class="drac-heading drac-heading-lg drac-text-purple-cyan">An introduction to the Ecosystem Toolkit</h2>

          <h3 class="drac-heading drac-heading-md drac-text-purple-cyan">Purpose</h3>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            There are many situations and contexts in which entities that share a common domain of interest could create value by collaborating with one another. Identity and eligibility assurance is one such use case, in which the benefits of collaboration are clear cut.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The primary objective of the Alpha Project was to develop a generalised and repeatable toolkit that can be easily deployed by any given entity to facilitate collaboration with other any other entity over any given domain of interest.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            This is referred to as the Ecosystem Toolkit.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The ideas contained within the Ecosystem Toolkit aim to connect expertise across collaborating entities without unnecessary friction. The Ecosystem Toolkit aims to remove barriers to collective action that prevent the emergence of collaborative ecosystems, reducing the incremental effort required either to set up a new ecosystem or to extend an existing one. It also allows for a greater level of interoperability between ecosystems.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            We envisage a future state in which the Ecosystem Toolkit helps significantly more collaborative ecosystems to emerge – and thereby create value.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            In the same way, the Ecosystem Toolkit can be seen as setting out an architectural style that can be used to implement a Trust Framework, constraining some design decisions in order to elicit a number of beneficial qualities, as described later under 'Design Goals'.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The Ecosystem Toolkit should not be confused with an instance of a trust framework or scheme that has been deployed to deliver a particular use case, and which has made its own specific implementation choices.
          </p>

          <h3 class="drac-heading drac-heading-md drac-text-purple-cyan">Components</h3>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The Ecosystem Toolkit can be seen as setting out an architectural style that can be used to implement Trust based and other Collaborative Frameworks, constraining some design decisions in order to elicit a number of beneficial qualities, as described in 'Design Goals'.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Many initiatives set out to establish technical standards . However, a key feature of the Ecosystem Toolkit is that it seeks to specify an approach for tackling those elements of collaboration and trust that go beyond the deployment of technical standards and is technology and vendor agnostic.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The heterogeneity of the different situations and contexts which might benefit from collaboration inevitably means that the legal, operational and behavioural aspects require as much – if not more – effort to specify and configure as any technical standard.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The Ecosystem Toolkit therefore comprises two major artefacts:
          </p>
          <ul class="drac-list drac-list-unordered drac-list-purple">
            <li class="drac-text drac-text-white"><span class="drac-text-bold">Rules of Engagement</span> to facilitate the agreement required for scalable, interoperable and extensible collaboration between participants within a given ecosystem.</li>
            <li class="drac-text drac-text-white"><span class="drac-text-bold">Technical Specification</span>, offering a generic approach based on open standards, to implement the execution of scalable, interoperable and extensible collaboration over the Events that – for example – might be used to record proof of identity or eligibility.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The Rules of Engagement comprises of different areas of concern, referred to in the Rules of Engagement itself as components: legal basis (e.g. consent), liability framework, assurance levels, service levels and issue resolution.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Each of these components is configurable (e.g. different levels of liability can be set), and the Rules of Engagement includes a default configuration for a minimum set of components which provides a basic framework agreement for collaboration between entities.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Of course, this basic framework will not meet the needs of entities looking to collaborate in situations that require relatively high levels of trust. The Rules of Engagement allow for new components to be added and for different configurations of each component.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            Importantly, specific instances (e.g. a defined level of liability, or a given issue resolution mechanism) of any component can be easily referenced by the machines (known as Expert Systems) that implement the Technical Specification.
          </p>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
            The intention is for easily repeatable patterns to emerge, as ecosystems compose and configure components to meet their needs for specific levels of assurance and trust. These patterns can be exposed in a machine-readable way to other entities looking to participate in the ecosystem, or by participants looking to create their own ecosystems operating in a different situation or context.
          </p>

          <h3 class="drac-heading drac-heading-md drac-text-purple-cyan">Event schema</h3>
          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
          One of the most important constraints imposed by the Technical Specification is the requirement to implement a universal and standardised Event schema.
          </p>

          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
          The Event schema is divided into Data Assertions and Metadata Assertions, where the Metadata Assertions capture the provenance of the Event and the Data Assertions expresses its content.
          </p>

          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
          The standardised Data Assertions ensure that the role of Event Producer (akin to that of the Issuer in a Verifiable Credential) is systematically captured as an integral part of the information itself . The Data Assertions of an Event are standardised in the form of an N-Tuple construct which may for example be an RDF triple.
          </p>

          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
          All Events therefore take the form of an attestation (“X says that Y is true”), whose provenance provides a basis for trust: at its simplest, an Event Consumer can decide how much confidence to place in the content of the Event based on the entity attesting to it.
          </p>

          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
          This standardised Event schema also means that:
          </p>

          <ul class="drac-list drac-list-unordered drac-list-purple">
            <li class="drac-text drac-text-white">The information exchanged between Expert Systems can be about anything – as a result, ecosystems are not restricted to any particular domain of interest</li>
            <li class="drac-text drac-text-white">A universal API can be used to move information between Expert Systems – there is no need to re-work or extend the client which consumes the API as circumstances change</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="drac-text drac-line-height drac-text-white">
          These properties hugely increase interoperability (both internally within an ecosystem and externally between ecosystems) and extensibility of solutions that are deployed in a way that conforms to the Ecosystem Toolkit. See 'Design Goals' for more detail.
