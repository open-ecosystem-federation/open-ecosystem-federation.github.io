## The Open Ecosystem Federation

### About

We are a federation of parties across Government, the private sector and academia.

We have a shared vision of developing a repeatable toolkit to build configurable, scalable, privacy enabled ecosystems for participants who share common domains of interest and are motivated to share insight/signals about those domains, but who want neither to share a common information infrastructure nor to rely on fragile point-to-point messaging structures.

The toolkit comprises two parts: a technical specification based on open standards and a default governance framework that addresses rules of engagement, legislation and ethics.

### Our mission

The OEFâ€™s mission is to establish and maintain an open and collaborative alliance across government, industry and academia that will:

* join expertise across organisations and individuals participating in mutually beneficial ecosystems to improve decision making and business processes close to real time at an ecosystemic level
* give control to participants over how and when they contribute their insight and expertise and what is done with it by others
* minimise data - reducing duplication in the administration and storage of and inference over information
* maximise local processing - to help remove unnecessary middlemen, centralisation and data lakes
* provide more scalable and extensible alternatives to the current friction filled share mechanisms and instruments
* reduce the impact of IT on the environment

### The Ecosystem Toolkit

The [Ecosystem Toolkit](ecosystem-toolkit) is a work in progress - we are currently working on a Private Beta due to finish January/February 2021.
