## The Open Ecosystem Federation

### About

We are a federation of parties across Government, the private sector and academia.

We have a shared vision of developing a repeatable toolkit to build flexible and scalable information ecosystems between participants who share common domains of interest and are motivated to share signals about those domains, but who want neither to share a common information infrastructure nor to rely on fragile point-to-point messaging structures.

The toolkit comprises two parts: a technical specification based on open standards and a default governance framework that addresses rules of engagement, legislation and ethics.

### Our mission

The OEFâ€™s mission is to establish and maintain an open and collaborative alliance across government, industry and academia that will:

* develop an ecosystem toolkit comprising a set of composable parts that permits parties to share tokens of value about common domains of interest, thereby enabling rapid decision making and inference based on the machine-readable composition of distributed effort and expertise
* deploy a reference implementation of the ecosystem toolkit
* promote the ecosystem toolkit as a mechanism to reduce the frictional cost of moving incremental information between parties; reduce the dependency on intermediate information infrastructure; reduce duplication in the administration of information; reduce duplication in the deployment of expertise and inference over that information; reduce the impact of IT on the environment
* maintain and evolve the ecosystem toolkit over time

### The Ecosystem Toolkit

The [Ecosystem Toolkit](ecosystem-toolkit) is a work in progress - we are currently working on a Private Beta due to finish January/February 2021.



### Motivation
