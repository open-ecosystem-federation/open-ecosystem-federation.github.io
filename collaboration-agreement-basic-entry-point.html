    <h3>Agreement type</h3>
    <p>
      The Network Participants wish to establish an Information Sharing Network on the basis set out in the agreement dated [          ] between Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, Food Standards Agency [and] Cabinet Office [and others] relating to the operation and activities of the ISN Framework (the <strong>Agreement</strong>).
    </p>
    <p>
      Given the identity of the Network Participants and the nature of the information that the Network Participants wish to share, the Network Participants wish to adopt an accelerated approach to the establishment of the information sharing network.
